Medicinal Plant Detection
This project is designed for Medicinal Plant Detection using machine learning models. The model helps to identify and classify different medicinal plants based on their images. This can be useful for educational purposes, botanical research, and even herbal medicine identification.

Features
Real-time medicinal plant identification.

Built using a ResNet50 model for accurate classification.

Developed with Flask for a web-based interface.

The system allows users to upload images of plants, and it will classify them into one of the predefined medicinal plant categories.

Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python (3.x)

Flask

Git

PyTorch

Steps
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Abyudaynalawade/medicinal-plant-detection.git
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash
Copy
Edit
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Open your browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to use the application.

Usage
Upload an image of a plant using the web interface.

The app will classify the plant and display the results.

Technologies Used
Python (for development)
