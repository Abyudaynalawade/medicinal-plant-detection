# Medicinal Plant Detection

This project is designed for **Medicinal Plant Detection** using machine learning models. The model helps to identify and classify different medicinal plants based on their images. This can be useful for educational purposes, botanical research, and even herbal medicine identification.

## Features

- Real-time medicinal plant identification.
- Built using a **ResNet50** model for accurate classification.
- Developed with **Flask** for a web-based interface.
- The system allows users to upload images of plants, and it will classify them into one of the predefined medicinal plant categories.
